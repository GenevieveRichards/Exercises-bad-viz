<h2>Answers</h2>
<p><strong>1. Parallel Coordinates</strong></p>
<p>In order to create a parallel plot you need to manipulate the data by spreading the name variable out across the rows.</p>
<p>This plot shows clear spikes, no data is occluded making it easy to determine values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>air_quality2 &lt;- dcast(air_quality,name~geo_entity_name, value.var = &quot;data_valuemessage&quot;)
ggparcoord(air_quality2,  columns = 2:ncol(air_quality2), groupColumn = &#39;name&#39;, scale = &#39;globalminmax&#39;) +   geom_point() +  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 5)
  ) </code></pre>
<p><img src="3DVIZ_ANS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Faceted Bar Chart</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(air_quality, aes(x = geo_entity_name, y = data_valuemessage, fill = name)) + 
  geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;, stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + facet_grid(rows = vars(name))  +    
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 4),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 4),
    strip.text.y = element_text(size = 6)
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="3DVIZ_ANS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /> <strong>3. Clustered Bar Chart</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(air_quality, aes(x = geo_entity_name, y = data_valuemessage, fill = name)) + 
  geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;, stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +         
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 4),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 4)
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="3DVIZ_ANS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Dot Chart</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(air_quality, aes(x = geo_entity_name, y = data_valuemessage,  col = name)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),

  )</code></pre>

<p>Based on the visualisations, the most effective charts are the <strong>Parallel Coordinates Charts</strong> and the <strong>Faceted Bar Chart</strong> as they provide information clearly without any clutter or visual occlusion.</p>
